# What can I use it for?

- This allows you to link your discord to websites such as discord.lucid-hub.de
- If you take out the automatic forwarding you have a button with a link to recommend people to click on this link.

# Who can use it?

- Anyone can use it as long as it doesn't violate any laws!
- I think it would be nice if you left the credit at the bottom center "Â© by Hexnrik".
- I think it's great if you change something in the code and upload it yourself, but not 1:1.

# How can I get help?

- Through our Discord Support Team. (https://discord.lucid-hub.de)
- Via email support. (hilfe@hexnrik.de)
- Otherwise everything else where you can reach me.
